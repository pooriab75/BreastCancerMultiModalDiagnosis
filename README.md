Stacking Ensemble Classifier for Multi-Modal Breast Cancer Diagnosis
This repository contains code, data, and supplementary materials for the manuscript "A Stacking Ensemble Classifier for Breast Cancer Detection Using Multi-Modal Data" submitted to the Journal of Biomedical Informatics (2025). The study integrates Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) data from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) and mammography data from CBIS-DDSM to develop a stacking ensemble classifier with high recall (0.944) and interpretability.

Model Training and Evaluation Pipeline
The flowchart below illustrates the final model training and evaluation pipeline, using a classification threshold of 0.3, as described in the manuscriptâ€™s supplementary materials (Flowchart of Final Model Training and Evaluation Pipeline).

Pipeline Overview[Flowchart of Final Model Training and Evaluation Pipeline.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19967472/Flowchart.of.Final.Model.Training.and.Evaluation.Pipeline.pdf)

Input: Merged WBCD and CBIS-DDSM dataset (3549 samples, six shared features: radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, symmetry_mean).
Process:
Preprocess and align features from WBCD and CBIS-DDSM datasets (e.g., Gaussian blur, VGG16, PCA, GLCM, Canny edge detection).
Train a stacking ensemble classifier (RandomForest, XGBoost, GradientBoosting, LightGBM, CatBoost, with Logistic Regression meta-model) using 5-fold cross-validation.
Evaluate on the test set (1028 samples) with a 0.3 threshold, achieving 87.6% accuracy and 0.944 recall.
Perform LIME analysis for interpretability on 10 instances (5 benign, 5 malignant).
